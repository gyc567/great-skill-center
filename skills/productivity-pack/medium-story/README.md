# medium-story — Hermes Agent Skill

Generate full Medium article packages from a single topic prompt: article in markdown, 90-second HeyGen video script, LinkedIn post, YouTube screencast script, fact-check report, and HTML versions ready for publishing. Includes a mandatory anti-AI-slop writing pass (Step 6b) that verifies the draft against banned vocabulary and structural tells before the output agents run.

## Quick Install

Copy and paste this to your Hermes agent (any profile):

```text
Install the medium-story skill into my Hermes agent. Clone
github.com/ciberjohn/Hermes-Skills to a temporary directory and copy
medium-story/SKILL.md into ~/.hermes/skills/creative/medium-story/SKILL.md.
If creative/ doesn't exist, create it. Then copy the contents of
medium-story/references/ into ~/.hermes/skills/creative/medium-story/references/.
After that, ask me these configuration questions one at a time:
1. Where is my Medium articles repository on disk? (absolute path)
2. What is the GitHub remote URL for that repository?
3. Where is my writing persona file?
4. Where is my md_to_html.py script located?
5. What Medium RSS feed URL should I cache (optional)?
6. What byline name should articles use?
When I answer each, store the values so the skill works next time I use it.
Finally, show me an example of how to invoke it: '/medium-story write an
article about why SSH key management still fails in 2026'.
```

## Prerequisites

- **Hermes Agent** — installed and configured (`pip install hermes-agent` or via [Nous Research](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com))
- **GitHub repository** — for your Medium articles, structured as `unpublished_stories/` and `published_stories/`
- **Medium account** — to publish the output
- **Python 3** — for the HTML conversion script (`markdown` library required)

## Installation

1. Copy `SKILL.md` to your Hermes skills directory:
   ```bash
   cp medium-story/SKILL.md ${SKILLS_DIR:-~/.hermes/profiles/default/skills/creative}/medium-story/SKILL.md
   ```

2. Configure the variables at the top of `SKILL.md`:
   - `{{MEDIUM_REPO_PATH}}` — absolute path to your Medium articles repo
   - `{{MEDIUM_REPO_URL}}` — Git remote URL
   - `{{PERSONA_FILE}}` — path to your persona template (see `templates/persona-template.md`)
   - `{{MD_TO_HTML_SCRIPT}}` — path to `scripts/md_to_html.py`
   - `{{SECRETS_FILE}}` — path to your env vars file (if any)

3. Copy the supporting files:
   ```bash
   cp templates/persona-template.md {{PERSONA_FILE}}
   cp scripts/md_to_html.py /your/repo/path/
   ```

4. Create the directory structure in your repo:
   ```
   your-medium-repo/
   ├── unpublished_stories/
   ├── published_stories/
   ├── published_index.md
   ├── medium_feed_cache.xml
   └── logs/
   ```

5. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install markdown
   ```

## Configuration Variables

Edit the top of `SKILL.md` to set:

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `{{MEDIUM_REPO_PATH}}` | Absolute path to your Medium repo | `~/Medium-Articles` |
| `{{GITHUB_REPO_URL}}` | Git remote URL | `github.com/user/Medium-Articles.git` |
| `{{MEDIUM_RSS_FEED_URL}}` | RSS feed URL for your Medium publication | `https://your-username.medium.com/feed` |
| `{{MEDIUM_USERNAME}}` | Your Medium publication username | `your-username` |
| `{{PERSONA_FILE}}` | Path to your persona prompt file | `templates/persona-template.md` |
| `{{MD_TO_HTML_SCRIPT}}` | Path to the HTML converter | `{MEDIUM_REPO_PATH}/md_to_html.py` |
| `{{PUBLISHED_AUTHOR}}` | Your byline as it should appear on articles | `Your Name` |
| `{{STORY_NUMBER}}` | Auto-incremented sequential story number (set by pipeline) | — |

## How It Works

The skill executes a 9-step pipeline:

1. **Sync repo** — pulls latest from Git
2. **RSS cross-reference** — checks published stories against Medium's RSS feed cache
3. **Read context** — loads persona, finds next story number
4. **Research** — spawns a subagent to research the topic
5. **Create directory** — creates `unpublished_stories/NN_slug/`
6. **Write** — subagent produces the article
7. **4 parallel agents** — Revisor, HeyGen Script, LinkedIn Post, YouTube Script
8. **HTML conversion** — runs `md_to_html.py`
9. **Git commit** — commits and pushes everything

## Output Files

Each story produces:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `medium-story.md` | Full article in markdown |
| `medium-story.fragment.html` | Paste-ready HTML for Medium |
| `medium-story.full.html` | Full-page HTML preview |
| `video-script.md` | 90-second HeyGen teleprompter script |
| `linkedin-post.md` | Standalone LinkedIn post (≤3,000 chars, 5 hashtags) |
| `youtube-script.md` | 8-12 minute screencast script with OBS notes |
| `revisor-fact-check-report.md` | Fact-check, spelling, and quality report |

## Writing Voice

The skill uses a writing voice defined in your persona file. The included `templates/persona-template.md` provides a starting point with:

- Core voice guidelines (direct, practitioner, British English)
- Pre-publish checklist (10 categories of AI-typical language to avoid)
- Configuration fields for your personal style, title, and experience

## Security Notes

- Never hardcode tokens or secrets in the skill file — use environment variables
- The skill references variables for paths, not absolute system paths
- Review the pre-publish checklist before publishing to ensure authentic voice

## Example

```bash
# Tell your Hermes agent:
"Write a Medium article about why SSH key management still fails in 2026"

# The agent loads the medium-story skill and runs the full pipeline.
# 5-10 minutes later, everything is committed to your repo.
```
